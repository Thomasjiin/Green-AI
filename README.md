# Green-AI - Deforestation tracking with AI 

 

 

 

1-Minute Preliminary Presentation Script for "AI-Powered Deforestation Tracking" 

Our team has chosen "AI-Powered Deforestation Tracking" as the topic for our project, which falls under the "Environment protectionl" category mentioned in the project guide . 

Deforestation is a critical environmental issue—losing forests disrupts ecosystems, worsens climate change, and threatens biodiversity. Traditional tracking methods (like manual surveys) are slow and limited in coverage, but AI can solve this by analyzing satellite or aerial images to detect deforestation areas quickly and accurately. 

So far, we’ve started reviewing existing AI applications in this field, such as using deep learning for land cover classification to spot deforestation hotspots. Next, we’ll search for 2 related papers via Arxiv, check if their data (like satellite image datasets) is open-source or publicly available, and confirm the access steps as required . 

We believe this topic matters because AI-driven tracking can help governments and NGOs take timely action to protect forests. That’s our preliminary plan—thank you! 

 

STATE OF ART 

1)Why deforestation is a problem  

 

-Environmental cause 

 

Environmental issues are among the most pressing challenges of our time. Human activities, combined with natural processes, have triggered large-scale transformations in the Earth’s ecosystems. These changes affect biodiversity, climate stability, and human livelihoods. The main causes of environmental degradation can be grouped into several key categories: 

    Deforestation and Land Use Change 
    Forests are being cleared at alarming rates for agriculture, urbanization, and mining. This leads to habitat loss, increased greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion, and disruption of the water cycle. In tropical regions, deforestation is also linked to illegal logging and expansion of cattle ranching. The loss of tree cover reduces the planet’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, directly accelerating global warming. 

    Climate Change 
    The combustion of fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and industry releases massive amounts of CO₂ and other greenhouse gases. This alters global temperature patterns, causing extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts. Melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and shifts in ecosystems are some of the long-term consequences. 

    Air and Water Pollution 
    Industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and agricultural runoff contaminate both air and water sources. Air pollution contributes to respiratory diseases, while polluted rivers and oceans threaten aquatic life and food security. Plastic pollution, in particular, has become a global crisis, affecting marine ecosystems and entering the food chain. 

    Soil Degradation and Desertification 
    Unsustainable agricultural practices—such as overgrazing, deforestation, and excessive use of fertilizers—lead to soil exhaustion and loss of fertility. Over time, this can result in desertification, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, reducing the availability of arable land and threatening food production. 

    Loss of Biodiversity 
    Species extinction rates are accelerating due to habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. The loss of biodiversity weakens ecosystem resilience and reduces essential services like pollination, water purification, and carbon storage. 

    Urbanization and Waste Generation 
    Rapid urban growth increases demand for energy, transportation, and infrastructure, leading to higher emissions and waste production. Inadequate waste management causes land and water contamination, while expanding cities encroach on natural habitats. 

 

-Why is it difficult to observe 

 

Why Deforestation Is Difficult to Observe 

Monitoring deforestation accurately and in real time is much harder than it may seem. Even with modern satellite technology, several factors make the process challenging: 

    Cloud Cover and Atmospheric Conditions 
    In tropical regions like the Amazon or Central Africa, clouds are present almost all year. Optical satellites such as Landsat or Sentinel-2 cannot capture clear images through clouds, meaning large areas are often invisible for weeks or even months. This causes delays and gaps in monitoring. 

    Data Availability and Temporal Resolution 
    Even when satellites revisit the same area frequently, not all images are usable because of cloud shadows, haze, or poor lighting conditions. Detecting subtle or gradual deforestation (like selective logging) requires long, clean time series, which are often incomplete. 

    Spectral Similarity and Noise 
    The difference between healthy forest, degraded forest, or cleared land can be small in spectral terms (the colors and intensities detected by sensors). Noise from sensors, variations in soil moisture, or seasonal vegetation changes can easily mask true deforestation signals. 

    Mixed Land Cover and Partial Disturbances 
    Deforestation doesn’t always happen as a clean cut of large forest blocks. It often starts with scattered tree removal, small fires, or road building. These subtle changes are hard to detect with coarse satellite resolutions or simple classification models. 

    Radar Data Complexity 
    Radar sensors (like Sentinel-1) can see through clouds, but their data is noisy and harder to interpret. Backscattering values depend on surface roughness and moisture, not just on vegetation presence, which complicates deforestation detection. 

    Validation and Ground Truth 
    Satellite-based detections must be validated with on-the-ground observations or high-resolution imagery. In remote or dangerous areas, this is difficult, expensive, and sometimes impossible, leading to uncertainties in accuracy estimates.
